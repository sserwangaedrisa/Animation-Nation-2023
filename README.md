_Sharpen your pencils, we're getting creative from here!_

Hello and welcome to Animation Nation, a ZTM project for Hacktoberfest! This site aims to showcase the creative talents of the ZTM community :)

# Rules

The rules are simple. You have to:

- Use HTML `<divs>` and CSS only! No JS, and no SVGs!
- Have at least one animation in your work
- Please make sure that the code is indeed your own, and not copied from someone else
- That's it!

# How to contribute

If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at [https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!

A cool resource to learn about the fork workflow can also be found here - [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In the Art directory (folder), create a directory named after your GitHub username.
2. Within this folder you just made, create two files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.
3. Link your CSS file to your HTML file.
4. Using only HTML and CSS (no `<script>` allowed!!), create a work of art! It can be as simple or as complex as you like, as long as it's animated in some way!
5. Get a screen recording of your finished work, **and make a gif**! Try to crop it so that it looks good as a smallish (preferably squarish) image. Save this in your directory, together with your HTML and CSS files. Static screenshots are also acceptable.  
   _If you don't add a gif/screenshot, the website won't show your animation._
6. Go to the root `include.js`. You will see an array of objects, each one represents a work of art that someone has created. Copy an example object and paste it at the end, filling it out with your art information and links:

```js
let cards = [
  //  Add your card in this section
  {
    artName: 'Triangle', // change this to the name of your artwork
    pageLink: './Art/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/triangle.html', // change this
    imageLink: './Art/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/triangle.gif', // change this
    author: 'Joy', // use your name
    githubLink: 'https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>' // change this
  }
];
```

# Important Note

If a maintainer asks for changes, _please make the required changes to your original pull request._

Closing a PR and re-opening the PR for the same contribution adds an unnecessary burden on maintainers,  
as they have to review the complete pull request again.

If you don't follow this rule, maintainers reserve the right to mark your pull request as invalid.

**In this case it won't count for Hacktoberfest**.
